Computer vision and ML based ps

I have attached the "COMPUTER VISION AND ML BASED PS" PDF document, which contains solution to questions that are found in the "IVDC-Autonomy-ps.pdf" file.

Additionally, for the last two coding questions I have Attached separate files:

For the 6th question, I have attached the "training-vs-inference" Jupyter notebook file.

For the 7th question, I have attached the "traffic-signal(2)" Jupyter notebook file.

INSTALLATION

solution to the 6th and 7th are specifically designed to work with that dataset, which can be downloaded from the provided URL link.
